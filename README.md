A small bot made using [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) API. It's porpuse is to fix Twitter links that fails to embed its content in Discord messages, by adding 'fx' to the beginning of the url.

It's not perfect, but I'm planning in improve it.

If there's two or more Twitter links in one message, only the first link will be sent.
